# Multilabel Classification Analysis

This project compares the performance of various algorithms applied to brain electroencephalography data that has mutilabel outputs. The importance of this project is to showcase how it is possible to use machine learning and data science in the field of neurodiagnosis. By being able to classify EEG data, the applications can be used for many purposes to aid people with various brain conditions. One of the datasets has data from daily activity classification with EEG data as the features, and the respective activity as the label.
